ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* README.md
* screenshot1.gif
* screenshot2.gif

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/BioHarnessBT.jar => app/libs/BioHarnessBT.jar
* libs/aware1.0.jar => app/libs/aware1.0.jar
* libs/commons-net-ftp-2.0.jar => app/libs/commons-net-ftp-2.0.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/edu/umass/cs/weka/accel.csv => app/src/main/resources/edu/umass/cs/weka/accel.csv
* src/edu/umass/cs/weka/ema.csv => app/src/main/resources/edu/umass/cs/weka/ema.csv

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
